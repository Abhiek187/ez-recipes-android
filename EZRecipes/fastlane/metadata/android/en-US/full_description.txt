Cooking food at home is an essential skill for anyone looking to save money and eat healthily. However, learning how to cook can be daunting, since there are so many recipes to choose from. Even when meal prepping, knowing what ingredients to buy, what equipment is required, and the order of steps to make the meal can be hard to remember for many different recipes. Plus, during busy days, it's nice to be able to cook up something quick and tasty.

Introducing EZ Recipes, an app that lets chefs find low-effort recipes that can be made in under an hour, use common kitchen ingredients, and can produce multiple servings. On one page, chefs can view what the recipe looks like, its nutritional qualities, the total cooking time, all the ingredients needed, and step-by-step instructions showing what ingredients and equipment are required per step. Each recipe can be shared so other chefs can learn how to make the same recipes.

Chefs can either find a random recipe or search for one using various filters, including by name, dietary restrictions, spice level, and meal type.

The app features a glossary to easily look up the meaning of common terms found in recipes. This will better assist newer chefs in learning how to cook, prep certain ingredients, and use certain kitchen tools.

Creating an account is free and unlocks more exciting features for chefs. This includes favoriting, rating, and syncing recipes across the web and mobile apps. For example, chefs can browse recipes on the web app and open them on the mobile app to cook them in the kitchen.

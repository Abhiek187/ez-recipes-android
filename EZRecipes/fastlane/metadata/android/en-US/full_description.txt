Cooking food at home is an essential skill for anyone looking to save money and eat healthily. However, learning how to cook can be daunting, since there are so many recipes to choose from. And even when meal prepping, knowing what ingredients to buy, what equipment is required, and the order of steps to make the meal can be hard to remember for many different recipes. Plus, during busy days, it's nice to be able to cook up something quick and tasty.

Introducing EZ Recipes, an app that lets chefs find low-effort recipes that can be made in under an hour, use common kitchen ingredients, and can produce multiple servings. On one page, chefs can view what the recipe looks like, its nutritional qualities, the total cooking time, all the ingredients needed, and step-by-step instructions showing what ingredients and equipment are required per step. Each recipe can be shared so other chefs can learn how to make the same recipes.
